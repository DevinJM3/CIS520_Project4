# CIS520_Project4

## Checkpoint 1: pthreads
### Tasks:
* Implement Project 4 using pthreads
### Deliverables:
* Upload a zip file containing:
  * Your pthreads code (even if you have not finished the pthreads implementation!)

## Checkpoint 2: Design and performance document
### Tasks:
* Start the performance evaluation of your pthreads implementation across a range of input sizes and core counts to see how the various versions match up in terms of run times, CPU efficiency, memory utilization, etc.
* Write a preliminary version of your design document (including a discussion of your software architecture and an initial performance analysis of your pthreads implementation)
### Deliverables:
* Upload a zip file containing:
  * Your performance evaluation (raw data) of your pthreads implementation (even if you have not finished the data collection!)
  * A preliminary design document in PDF format (including the initial analysis of your collected raw performance data for your pthreads implementation)
 
## Checkpoint 3: MPI
### Tasks:
* Implement Project 4 using MPI
* Do a performance evaluation of your MPI implementation across a range of input sizes and core counts to see how the various versions match up in terms of run times, CPU efficiency, memory utilization, etc.
* Update your design document with information about your MPI implementation and performance analyses of your pthreads and MPI implementations, noting and discussing any performance differences you find
### Deliverables:
* Upload a zip file containing:
  * You MPI code (even if you have not finished the MPI implementation!)
  * Your performance evaluation (raw data) of your MPI implementation (even if you have not finished the data collection!)
  * Your updated design document in PDF format (including an analysis and comparison of your performance data for your pthreads and MPI implementations)
